Applying This Style to an RPG Deckbuilder
	•	Color Palette:
	•	Keep gold as your primary accent to convey opulence.
	•	Pair it with a neutral range of greys or charcoal blacks as your base.
	•	Use a single rich accent color (like muted red, burgundy, or teal) sparingly to create focus areas without overpowering the gold.
	•	Geometric Motifs:
	•	Incorporate circular frames or “halo” designs behind character portraits on the card.
	•	Use stepped borders or angular panels in card layouts to recall Art Deco’s signature lines.
	•	Iconography & Symbolism:
	•	Lean into repeated circular or radiant motifs to convey power and importance (e.g., radial bursts behind key icons).
	•	Combine simple, flat silhouettes with bold metallic lines for clarity at card size.
	•	Texture & Finish:
	•	Simulate the look of brushed or polished gold on borders and key icons.
	•	Keep character or creature artwork relatively flat with minimal shading—focusing instead on silhouettes and decorative outlines to ensure they “pop” on a small card.
	•	Overall Feel:
	•	Aim for a “mythic deco” vibe: grand, regal, slightly mystical, and clearly referencing early 20th-century high style.
	•	Even if it’s a fantasy RPG, those Art Deco lines and shapes can communicate prestige, ceremony, and an otherworldly sophistication.

In short, this piece combines the opulent geometry of Art Deco with a touch of Art Nouveau ornamentation. For an RPG deckbuilder, you can use the same emphasis on circular framing, stylized outlines, and a luxurious gold palette to produce cards that feel both majestic and historically inspired
