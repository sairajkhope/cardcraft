# Concept 

RPG Deckbuilder Layout

# Theme

Before delving into how you might use this aesthetic for an RPG deckbuilder, here’s a step-by-step look at the image’s style, color palette, and underlying influences:

	1.	Overall Art Style & Historical Roots
	•	Art Deco & Art Nouveau Fusion: The strong geometric halos, bold outlines, and symmetrical layout evoke the refined opulence of Art Deco (popular in the 1920s–1930s). At the same time, the ornate lines around the female figure’s hair and flowing garments show a hint of Art Nouveau’s organic curves.
	•	Religious/Iconic Inspiration: The circular “halos” and the central vertical figure are reminiscent of stained-glass windows or religious iconography, but interpreted through a sleek, modernized lens typical of Deco design.

	2.	Main Colors
	•	Gold: Dominant and often rendered as metallic or brushed. This creates a luxurious, luminous quality.
	•	Greys and Off-Whites: The background and much of the mid-ground rely on cool greys and pale whites, helping the gold elements stand out.
	•	Muted Red/Maroon Accents: Notice the subtle red tones in the figure on the right. They bring warmth and contrast without competing heavily against the gold.
	•	Black or Charcoal: Used for outlines and for blocks of negative space, creating contrast and a sense of crispness.

	3.	Time Period & Historical Associations
	•	1920s–1930s Art Deco: Characterized by luxurious materials (gold, chrome, mirrors) and bold, geometric ornamentation. This image has that same underlying aesthetic: streamlined shapes and lavish touches.
	•	Nouveau Influences (Late 19th – Early 20th Century): The flowing, sinuous lines around the female figure’s hair and the flourish-like details bridging the shapes.
